# workflow for communication with eps1lon/mui-scripts-incubator
# These scripts are experimental. We have a very "dumb" workflow here that is only responsible for triggering
# actions in eps1lon/mui-scripts-incubator. Since those actions are experimental they'll likely break
# and we don't want to disrupt the normal repo workflow.
